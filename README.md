# Numsectorlisp
Numsectorlisp is a library for [SectorLISP](https://github.com/jart/sectorlisp),
for scalar, vector, and matrix multiplication of fixed-point numbers.
The number of bits for the fractional part and the decimal part can be easily configured.
The default setting implements 16-bit fixed-point numbers with 12 bits for the fractional part,
3 bits for the integer part, and 1 bit for the sign.
